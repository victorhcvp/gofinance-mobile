# GoFinance App

This is a financial organization app built with React Native and Typescript. Its initial idea was to make my life easier by stopping using Excel sheets.

## How it works

You can start by adding your expenses and incomes categories, then you add your actual expenses and incomes using the previously created categories to better organize everything.

Finally you can enter the summary/resume screen to see everything you earned and spent by day, month or year.

## Technologies

- React Native
- Typescript
- Async Storage

## Plans for the future

- Create a web version
- Use an authentication system to sync between app and web
- Save data externally instead of internal storage
- Design a better UI/UX

## How to compile/run

- Use `yarn` to download and sync dependencies
- `yarn android` or `yarn ios` to compile and execute the app within a simulator
